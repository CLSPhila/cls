					<h3>Why would someone ever use a tool like this?</h3>
					<p>This is a tool intended for lawyers and advocates who represent clients in <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-paychecks-each-year-survey-data-show-millions-of-workers-are-paid-less-than-the-minimum-wage-at-significant-cost-to-taxpayers-and-state-economies/" target="_blank">wage theft cases</a>. Unfortunately, many low-wage workers work for exploitative employers who fail to keep proper records of hours worked, pay owed, pay disbursed, etc...  For a worker who is not properly paid, this lack of records can make it very difficult to determine how much the worker should have been paid and thus the employer's liability to the employee.</p>
					<p>An example: Many restaurant dishwashers earn a set amount of money each week, regardless of how many hours were worked.  Assume Worker makes $400/week as a dishwasher, but works variable hours.  Based on how busy the restaurant is on a given week, Worker works between 50 and 65 hours a week.</p>
					<p>These types of variable hours are common in the restaurant industry (among many others). If Worker doesn't punch in and out when starting and finishing shifts, it is impossible to accurately determine what Worker is owed.  This is where the Location History Analyzer comes in handy.</p>

					<h3>How would Worker's lawyer use this tool?</h3>
					<p>Worker will likely have a reasonable recollection about the average number of hours worked each week. Worker's phone, however, may have a more accurate "recollection" about Worker's weekly schedule. </p>
					<p>If Worker uses google location tracking (this is more likely if Worker has an Android phone), Worker's lawyer can use this tool to get Worker's exact weekly hours at the restaurant, instead of an estimate of hours.  The tool's output can be introduced in court as evidence of what Worker is owed.</p>

					<h3>What are the Potential Pitfalls of This Tool?</h3>
					<p>There are two main pitfalls of this tool.  The first is that the tool only works when location tracking was previously turned on AND when a worker brings her phone to work each day.  Any day where location history wasn't on or the phone was left at home is a day without tracking, which will make the results less helpful.  The second is that google location tracking uses both GPS and cell tower locations to determine an individual's location.  When cell towers are used, google only knows, generally, where the person is. This doesn't mean that the tool is useless, but it does mean that a person may appear to be 500 feet away from where he really was at any given time.  This isn't fatal, especially if a worker only goes to the vacinity of a workplace to work.  All locations near the workplace should be considered work.  But the if a worker lives near work or goes out socially near work, this tool will not be able to distinguish between work and non-work hours.</p>
