				  <h1>Using the Location History Analyzer in Court</h1>
				  <p>This is not intended to be a full brief on any of the issues, but a short exploration and flagging of potential legal issues that may come up in the use of the Location History tool.  Please do your own research and please let the authors of this page know if there are any glaring omissions or inaccuracies.</p>

					<h3>Is GPS Data from a phone hearsay?  What about output from this program?</h3>
					<p>Because <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_801">Rule 801 of the Federal Rules of Evidence</a> requires a declarant to make a statement, and defines a declarant as a person who makes a statement, assertions by non-humans cannot be hearsay.  § 6716 Assertions of Non-Human “Declarants”, 30B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. § 6716 (2017 ed.).  Think of a clock or a thermometer - the 'statement' by the clock of a time or a thermometer of temperature is not something that can be cross-examined so it isn't an assertion that we are concerned about with respect to hearsay doctrine.  This isn't to say that statements by non-humans aren't potentially problematic and subject to questions of reliability.  Was the clock running fast or slow?  Who set the clock?  Was the thermometer properly calibrated?  These are are relevant questions with non-human declarants but they are not hearsay objections--they are reliability questions.  Id.</p>
					<p>As well, it is worth thinking about whether the output of the machine is really just a reflection of the input of a human.  A scoreboard, for example, may reflect a score of 8-1, but that is just a reflection of an human that input that score.  Id.  Similarly, a computer program may output an "answer" to a question.  That answer likely is a reflection of some degree of human programing and decision making.  So the answer itself may not be correct and may include hearsay statements that were part of the input.</p>
					<p>How does that all fit in the context of using location data?  Well, arguably the GPS location data itself should be seen as non-hearsay.  This would be a similar finding to the Ninth Circuit in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14860261481331748363">U.S. v. Lizarraga-Tirado, 789 F.3d 1107, 1110 (9th Cir. 2010)</a>, when it allowed the use of Google Earth (similar to google maps) to show the location of a set of GPS coordinates on a map:</p>
					<p>"[T]he relevant assertion isn't made by a person; it's made by the Google Earth program. Though a person types in the GPS coordinates, he has no role in figuring out where the tack will be placed. The real work is done by the computer program itself. The program analyzes the GPS coordinates and, without any human intervention, places a labeled tack on the satellite image. Because the program makes the relevant assertion—that the tack is accurately placed at the labeled GPS coordinates—there's no statement as defined by the hearsay rule."</p>
					<p>So the GPS data from the likely isn't going to be seen as hearsay.  The output of this program is potentially hearsay, though.  Because of that, we recommend the use of an expert who can testify as to how the program works in any court case.</p>
