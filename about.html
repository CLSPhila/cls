                  <h1>About Location History Analyzer</h1>
                  <h2>The Location History Analyzer was created in 2016 through a collaboration between <a href="https://hack4impact.org/" target="_blank">Hack4Impact</a> and <a href="https://clsphila.org" target="_blank">Community Legal Services</a>.  The original purpose of the tool was to help develop evidence of hours worked for low-wage workers who are working in an environment lacking accurate time records.  Unfortunately, this is a common problem.</h2>
					<p>The good news is that in the absence of accurate employer records (which they are required by law to keep), <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/328/680" target="_blank">workers are able to produce whatever evidence they can that reasonably shows the amount of work performed.</a>  Lawyers regularly rely on the testimony of their worker-clients or on the hand-kept records of those workers to prove an emplyoer's liability.  Because a worker's memory can be challenged, especially when hours vary frequently or work was performed over a long period of time, as can a worker's credibility, it helps to have evidence to supplement or corroborate the worker's memory.</p>
					<p>The intention of this tool is to allow workers a way to supplement/corroborate their memory with an objective tool that collects data not for the purpose of litigation, but for some other commercial (and perhaps a bit creepy/scary) purpose.  The tool takes as input a Google location history geo-json file.  This file is generated automatically by google on any phone that has google location tracking enabled (many android phones inadvertantly have this turned on).  The tool quickly analyzes the file and plots the individual's location history on a map.  The worker or advocate can then draw a bounding box around each work location during the relevant time period.  The tool then analyzes the map and boxes and creates a spreadsheet that is, in essence, an timelog for that worker.</p>
